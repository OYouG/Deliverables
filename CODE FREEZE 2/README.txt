OYG Front-End CODE FREEZE 2

Featuring:
Improved visualization load times (look at how fast those things load! - compared to CODE FREEZE 1, these visualizations load nearly 3 times as fast!)

Added pie charts (see Ticket Sales Dashboard!)

Made some miscellaneous other changes (small text things here and there, overall readability changes, etc.)

Laid the groundwork to switch to a horizontal nav bar (an easy task but something we’re still waiting on client approval for - which is why it didn’t make it into this code freeze!)
